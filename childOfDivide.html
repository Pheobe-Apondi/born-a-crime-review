            <p>I have been contemplating on what I would rename Trevor Noah's book <strong>Born A Crime</strong> if I was given a chance. 
                After much analysis of the book,
                 I've settled on THE IN-BETWEEN CHILD: A story from the divide.</p>
            <p>This is a suitable title because of the themes explored in the book.
                 It is a memoir of a young boy, an anamoly,who faces struggles of not
                  belonging to either race, class, culture or school. His conception and birth
                   is the first divide we see, a child born from a white Swiss dad and a black Xhosa woman. 
                   He is neither black nor white. He is termed colored, but throughout the book we see how even the colored community rejected him.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    He was too black for whites, too white for blacks and too black for coloreds. We see how he uses humor and language to connect and
                     find a place to belong. Even in the school setup, he did not know which group he should have joined, every group was formed on the basis of 
                     race. He had to choose where he belonged otherwise the world would have made that choice for him.
            </p>
            <h1>Gender Roles and Relationship Expectations</h1>
            <p id="quote">"Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife… but he never fell in love with subservient women… 
                'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.'”</p>

                <p>Abel was raised in a patriarchal culture that had clear defined roles for men and women. Women bowed down while greeting men.
                     Despite coming from a culture that had traditional expectations, he married a woman who didn't embody these traits.
                      Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah was a woman who didn't let society dictate her role. She chose to have a child out of wedlock,
                       raised Trevor alone despite the systemic apartheid, poverty and patriarchy. She was independent and free-spirited. Rather 
                       than adjusting his expectations, Abel tried to change her and mold her into the traditional woman he desired leading to a pattern of
                        emotional abuse, violence and in the end a failed attempt to kill her.
                            <br>
                    Across many cultures globally, women like Patricia, women who rebel against patriarchal norms are often labelled as "difficult" or
                     "disrespectful". Due to women having the choice to work and also economic inequalities, women now take up roles that were traditionally 
                     reserved for men but still the traditional expectations set on them still persevere. Men raised to expect subservience or submission from
                      women struggle with independent women and this struggle is often translated to abuse which in some cases result in death. As long as society clings to rigid ideas of what women should be and men must be, stories like Patricia’s will remain both deeply personal and universally relevant.</p>
